## Key Features

* **Real-time Detection:**  Analyzes network traffic in real-time to identify suspicious patterns and potential attacks.
* **Machine Learning-Driven:** Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, deep learning) for accurate detection of malware activity.
* **Feature Engineering:** Extracts relevant features from network traffic data, such as packet size, source/destination IP addresses, port numbers, etc.
* **Adaptability:** Can be trained and adapted to detect new and evolving malware strains.
* **Scalability:** Designed to handle large-scale network environments with varying traffic loads.

## Dataset

* **NSL-KDD:** A widely used benchmark dataset for network intrusion detection research.
* **CICIDS2017:** A comprehensive dataset containing modern network traffic and attack scenarios.
* **Custom Dataset:** Option to collect and label your own network traffic data for tailored model training.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Clean and normalize network traffic data.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical features (e.g., protocol types).
2. **Feature Engineering:** 
   - Extract relevant features that capture the essence of normal and malicious network behavior.
3. **Model Training and Selection:**
   - Experiment with various machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective model.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and false-positive rate on a test dataset.
5. **Deployment:**
   - Integrate the trained model into a network security infrastructure for real-time monitoring and alerting.

## Model Evaluation

Include a table or summary of your model's performance metrics on the chosen dataset:

| Model        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest | 98.2%    | 96.5%    | 97.9%  | 97.2%    |
| ...          | ...      | ...      | ...    | ...      |

## Getting Started
